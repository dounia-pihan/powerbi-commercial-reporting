## Context & Objectives
- **Before**:  
  - Sales data consolidated manually by **two employees** across **two separate networks**.  
  - Lengthy and repetitive monthly processing in Excel/PivotTables.  
  - Distribution via email or SharePoint ‚Üí fragmented and limited visibility for sales directors and field reps.  

- **After** *(what I have done)*:  
  - Design and development of **two twin Power BI reports**, one for each network, built on the same model ‚Üí **scalability and consistency**.  
  - Creation of a **dedicated Power BI App** centralizing this report and other dashboards ‚Üí a **single access point** for the entire sales force.  
  - Outcome: strong adoption, report used **daily** by the entire sales organization.
